Implementation of machine learning algorithms from **Andrew Ng's Coursera course**, originally developed in MATLAB/OCTAVE as part of the programming assignments.

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains:
- MATLAB implementations of core ML algorithms
- Solutions to Coursera programming exercises
- Helper functions used in the course

## üß† Algorithms Implemented

### Core Algorithms
| Algorithm | MATLAB Files | Course Week |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | [`linearReg.m`](linearReg.m), [`gradientDescent.m`](gradientDescent.m) | Week 2 |
| Logistic Regression | [`logisticReg.m`](logisticReg.m), [`costFunction.m`](costFunction.m) | Week 3 |
| Neural Networks | [`nnCostFunction.m`](nnCostFunction.m), [`predict.m`](predict.m) | Week 4 |
| Support Vector Machines | [`svmTrain.m`](svmTrain.m), [`gaussianKernel.m`](gaussianKernel.m) | Week 7 |
| K-Means & PCA | [`kMeans.m`](kMeans.m), [`pca.m`](pca.m) | Week 8 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### MATLAB Installation
1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed (R2020b or later recommended)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Machine-learning-algorithms.git
   ```
3. Add the project folder to MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('/path/to/repository'));
   ```

### OCTAVE Alternative
For users without MATLAB:
1. Install [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
2. All files are compatible with Octave 6.0+

## üìä Running the Code

### Example: Linear Regression
```matlab
% Load data
data = load('ex1data1.txt');
X = data(:, 1); y = data(:, 2);

% Run gradient descent
theta = gradientDescent(X, y, zeros(2,1), 0.01, 1500);

% Plot results
plot(X(:,2), y, 'rx', 'MarkerSize', 10);
hold on;
plot(X(:,2), X*theta, '-');
```

### Example: Neural Networks
```matlab
% Load pre-trained weights
load('ex3weights.mat');

% Make predictions
pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);
accuracy = mean(double(pred == y)) * 100;
fprintf('Training Set Accuracy: %f\n', accuracy);
```

## üìà Course Exercise Mapping

| MATLAB File | Corresponding Exercise |
|-------------|------------------------|
| `ex1.m` | Linear Regression with One Variable |
| `ex2.m` | Logistic Regression |
| `ex3.m` | Multi-class Classification with NNs |
| `ex4.m` | Neural Network Backpropagation |
| `ex5.m` | Bias-Variance Analysis |
| `ex6.m` | Support Vector Machines |
| `ex7.m` | K-Means & PCA |

## üîç Key Features

- **Original MATLAB/OCTAVE implementations** as done in the course
- **Vectorized operations** for efficient computation
- **Detailed comments** explaining each step
- **Visualization scripts** for algorithm behavior

## üìù Notes for Developers

1. File naming follows Coursera's original structure
2. All functions are self-contained (no toolboxes required)
3. Test data included in `/data` directory

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

While this is primarily a course repository, improvements are welcome:
- Bug fixes in implementations
- Additional documentation
- Performance optimizations

**Please maintain MATLAB/OCTAVE compatibility** when submitting changes.

Key differences from the Python version:
1. **MATLAB-specific setup instructions**
2. **Original course file structure** preserved
3. **MATLAB code examples** with proper syntax
4. **Octave compatibility** noted
5. **Exercise mapping** to original Coursera problems
6. **No dependency management** (MATLAB doesn't use pip/requirements.txt)

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific MATLAB debugging tips?
2. Include screenshots of example outputs?
3. Add a comparison between MATLAB and Python implementations?
